# ReactGify

React app that implements Giphy API

- The page should never reload.
- Provide a form for the user to perform a keyword search against the GIF database via the API.
- Display the results as still thumbnails on the page in a layout that makes sense. A large volume of results should load in a performance-minded fashion.
- Clicking on a thumbnail should launch a lightbox-style modal view that allows the user to browse through individual GIFs as a slideshow. The GIFs in this view \* should be fully animated.
- Create a polished visual design and user experience.
- Code in a clean, readable way following all normal conventions.
- The goal is for you to create your own lightbox and slideshow app - do not use a prebuilt solution.
- Develop and test your work using a desktop Chrome/Chromium browser. Your work will be manually reviewed using desktop Chrome/Chromium, exclusively.
- If you have any notes or instructions about the exercise, please write them in the file README.md.
